# RLLVM

RLLVM is an R interface to [LLVM](http://llvm.org). This interface
allows one to create compiled code from within R through LLVM's
intermediate representation (IR), which LLVM can then extensively and
efficiently optimize.


For examples, see the
[RLLVM page on Omegahat](http://www.omegahat.net/Rllvm/).
